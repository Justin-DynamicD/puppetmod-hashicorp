# puppetmod-hashicorp
This module manages installation of the core Hashicorp tools used as well as base templates
for operation in Lantern.  Installation of components are managed by leveraging scripts
from registry.terraform.io (thus functionally idenitical to terraform deployments), whereas
actual templates are functionally unqiue to Lantern.
